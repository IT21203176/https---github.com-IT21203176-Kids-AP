# 🪐React Frontend Application Using NASA APIs - Astro Pals 🪐

## 📍 Introduction:
This project aims to develop a creative frontend application using React functional components. The application will consume data from NASA's public APIs available at NASA API portal.

### **Functional Requirements:

#### 1. Technology Stack
- Frontend: React (with functional components)
- Language: JavaScript
- CSS Framework: Tailwind CSS
- Backend: REST API for user management. (For login use below credentials or you can signup)
  - Email: janu@gmail.com 
  - Password: JanuS517
- Version Control: Git




#### 2. NASA API Integration:
This project integrates with NASA's APIs to retrieve fascinating data related to space exploration and astronomy. Leveraging the following endpoints:

  i. Mars Rover Photos API 📸
  
  The Mars Rover Photos API provides access to the vast collection of images captured by NASA's Mars rovers - Curiosity, Opportunity, and Spirit. Users can query images by sol (Martian day) or a range of sols, as   well as by camera type and Martian rover.

  ii. Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) API 🖼️
  
  The Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) API delivers a new astronomical image or photograph of the universe along with a brief explanation written by a professional astronomer. Each day, a different image or      photograph of the cosmos is featured, along with a description of the significance or scientific relevance of the image.

  iii. Asteroids - NeoWs API 🌠
  
  The Asteroids - NeoWs (Near Earth Object Web Service) API provides data on asteroids and comets that have passed near Earth in the past, or are predicted to do so in the future. This API offers information on     the orbits, sizes, velocities, and other properties of these celestial bodies, aiding in the study of potential near-Earth threats and understanding the dynamics of our solar system.

Through this integration, users can explore stunning imagery of Mars, discover captivating snapshots of the cosmos, and stay informed about celestial objects that come close to our planet.
